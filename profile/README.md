# DnD Project

Welcome to our open source project about Dungeons and Dragons!

## The idea
We are still working on the requirements, but here is the current idea:
> "An opensource platform in which people can homebrew and share their ideas over the internet. This interface will provide everyone a place in which they can play their DnD oneshots and campaigns with 5e rules as a base and their own or shared rules integrated, with automatic roll checks and a classy representation of whatever is happening! Can't wait to see it? Join our team now!"

## How are we doing this?
We are still working on that part, but here we'll be showing our tech stack and models, so anyone can cooperate with us, or create their own add-ons!

### The current stack
We are working on the backend right now, so to make it work we are working on `Node.js` with `TypeScript`, with that on mind, for a first (and quite big!) injection of content, we are borrowing the database from the `5e-database` repo, so, special thanks to the people on `5e-bits` and their great community!

### How to collaborate?
We are a closed team right now, cause we are developing the idea yet, but our "home rules" will be public on the repo collection with the naming `Base-*`, so whenever we open our team to the world you can be prepared! The models and logic however will be going to be public when we decide an structure for it, in the meanwhile they are still in progress, so spare ourselves ^-^'
